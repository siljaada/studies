This project was carried out for the course Introduction to Data Science. The purpose was to implement a Jupyter Notebook, a Jupyter workbook that can be used as a basis for your future data science projects. The development of the data science project base served as a kind of learning diary, combining snappy notes with code examples and links to sources of additional information.
