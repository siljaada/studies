This project is made for the course Data Structures and Algorithms. Parts of the project have been implemented by the course staff, my own modifications are in the data structure.cc and data structure.hh files, where functions have been created to create different connections between trains and stations.  The purpose of this project was to build a program to study train timetables. It also had to evaluate the effectiveness of its own implementation.
